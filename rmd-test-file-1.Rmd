## Creating variables in R

Variables allow you to store information within keywords. This stored information can be a single data element, like a string, a number, or a boolean, or variables can be used to store more complicated data structures such as lists, dataframes, graphs, and custom user-created functions. 

Variables in R are created using the following notation: <-


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
